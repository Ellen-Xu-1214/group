# Random Group Maker
This is a react app used for group work. <br>
Initially it is designed for teachers to make students into groups for project or discussion. <br>
Students can upload their names to the database and go to their own group. In a group, students can break a project down into tasks, and assign the tasks in a fun and fair way.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
