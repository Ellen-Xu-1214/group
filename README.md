This is a react app used for group work. <br>
It is designed for teachers to make students into groups for project or discussion.  <br>
Students can upload their names to the database and go to their own group after the teacher has made groups. <br>
In a group, students can break a project down into tasks, and assign the tasks in a fun and fair way.
